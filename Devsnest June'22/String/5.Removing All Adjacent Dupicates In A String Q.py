Given a string s which consists of lowercase English letters. Removing duplicates means choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.(Answer is proven as unique)

Input Format
First Parameter - String s

Output Format
Return the string

Example 1:
Input: s = "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: From the "abbaca" remove bb then the result is aaca then 
again remove aa which makes the remaing string as "ca".
Example 2:
Input: s = "azxxzy"
Output: "ay"
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
Time complexity: O(n)
Auxillary space complexity: O(n)
